PROBLEM STATEMENT

Provide insights on the donors, donation frequency and donation value,and use these information to make recommendations.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Number of donors, 
The sum of donation from donors not affiliated with any university is about 50% of the total donation. This might be as a result of missing information or due to the fact that donors never attended universities. If as a result of missing information, appreciation emails can be sent to donors, with subsequent request for their universities. Advocacy to such universities, and also to universities with low total donation could increase the number of donors. 
In addition to appreciation emails, logo-crested t-shirts in favourite colour can be given to donors who donate above 400. This can be clearly stated among the donor souvenirs to improve donation.

2. Donation frequency 
Generally, the sum of donations yearly or one-time are the most, perhaps an awareness can be done in months preceding to the charity event, as donors have showed an affinity to contribute more if not required too often. 
California, however, is the top state with daily contributions. Thus, the model used in the state can be applied to other states, as this method ensured California provided highest donation to the charity.

3. Value of donations. 
It might be important to focus on the top 5 job fields, Human Resources, Research & Development, Product Management, Business Development and Engineering contributing to the highest number of donations, and also number of donations. HR, R & D, and Business Development are also the fields contributing the most in California, the state with the highest donation. These fields can therefore increase the number of donors and value of donation. 
A record of the gender contributing the most in highest donor states would provide information on the effort needed to reach genders that are not well represented. The same could apply in lowest donor states.
